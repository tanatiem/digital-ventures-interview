# Digital Ventures Interview
By: Tanat Iempreedee

As a part of job interview with Digital Ventures, please find my deliverables at this repository.
My main tool to develop the model is Jupyter Notebook.

## Files
In order to keep the code not too long, I divided them into 3 parts
- `01 Clean.ipynb` is for data cleaning.
- `02 Prep & EDA.ipynb` is for basic EDA, feature engineering, and data preprocessing
- `03 Modeling.ipynb` is the main part where I split datasets, train the model, report model performance and interpretability.

Please note that each part produce output files after it's done. This is my personal habit to save state of the work.  
In case something crashes, I don't have to restart all over. But the file are too big to upload due to GitHub limitation, not all the files are uploaded.
